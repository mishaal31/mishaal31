❖｡･ About Me ｡･❖

Hi! I’m Mishaal

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am passionate about software development and problem-solving ^_^. I enjoy creating projects that are both practical and challenging constantly learning new technologies, and refining my programming skills ;P. My goal is to build software that makes a real impact while expanding my knowledge in computer science.

❖｡･ What I Do ｡･❖
As a Computer Science student, I explore multiple areas of technology.
I enjoy:
• Designing software that solves real-world problems 
• Combining logic with creativity to make efficient solutions
• Improving my coding skills through hands-on projects and challenges
• Learning and experimenting with new frameworks, languages, and tools

❖｡･ Tech Stack ｡･❖
I work with a range of technologies and tools to build projects efficiently:
• Programming Languages: Python, C++, C# :D
• Database: SQL :)
• Development: Console Applications, Windows Applications :P
• Tools & Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Version Control

❖｡･ Projects ｡･❖
Here are some of the key projects I have developed:
• Hostel Management System – A system to manage student records, room allocations, and payment details :D. Features include student registration, fee tracking, and report generation.
• Library Management System – A secure system with multiple user roles for librarians and students ^_^. Features include issue tracking, book inventory management, and authentication for librarians.
• Number Catching Game – A fun console-based game developed in C++ ;) to practice logic, loops, and user interaction. Users catch numbers falling randomly and score points, making it both educational and entertaining.
